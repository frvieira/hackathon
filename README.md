#Hackathon Project 48H


This project was developed on 48h and after 3 months of learning Java, during the bootcamp of Academia de Codigo held on ISCTE (remotely).


AREYOUSHORE is an webapp that allows the user to check if a beach is too crowded and doesn't enable people to preserve the social distancing required for the current situation (COVID19 Pandemic). 
It tracks the amount of people that are at a beach at that time.The data is updated by the Lifeguard and the User (to be implemented).
